General:
1. It seems, certain key presses (like arrows) hangs user input listener
   thread.
2. C/C++ client API

Journaling extension:
1. Currently reproducible state for j.txt in log extesnion: messages that are
   late by >1 chunk get lost. Shall resolve it by lookup for corresponding
   block, re-allocating it and adding this late message entry. Though, lookup
   and re-allocation procedure is expensive, we do not expect it to happen
   frequently. Also re-fragmenting (elder?) blocks would be a nice idea (file
   caching?).
2. "slow joiner" problem for pub/sub, see here: https://zguide.zeromq.org/docs/chapter5/
   In Python server script we currently workaround this problem with explicit
   delay. Correct way of resolving this would need introduction of additional
   ROUTER/DEALER kind of connection. We plan to use this kind of conversation
   anyway.
3. ANSI escape sequences shall be probably filtered out from log messages as
   they not interpreted by ncurses anyway.
4. Let's restrict minimum virtual width of journaling extension with 80 chars
5. Scrolling support for journaling extension
